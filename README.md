### üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Donato

I build intelligent robotic systems that bridge **AI, perception & control, and real-world deployment**.  

I enjoy working on:
- Writing clean and high quality code in C/C++, Python, and Bash ... and always learning new languages  
- Robotics platforms with ROS 2, Behavior Trees, Gazebo/Isaac Sim, Localization/Mapping/SLAM, Perception Pipelines  
- Flexible, scalable systems using Docker, Kubernetes, Edge/Cloud Architectures, and CI/CD 

‚≠êÔ∏è *Passionate about shaping the next generation of intelligent, flexible robotic systems that augment human work and make automation more accessible across industries.*
